{"title":"Vanilla Mint Iced Coffee","text":"Grind your coffee beans to the coarsest setting. This is the grinder* we love. Combine your grounds and water in a large mason jar (or cold press maker* if you’re fancy), making sure your grounds are fully saturated. Steep on the counter or in the fridge for about 18 hours. That’s the sweet spot! Strain. If you’re doing the jar method, put some cheesecloth over a fine-mesh strainer and strain the coffee into a clean jar.","giphy":"https://media2.giphy.com/media/gOQ6EgtAiwXde/giphy.gif","emoji1":15,"emoji2":2,"emoji3":3}
