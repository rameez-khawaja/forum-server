{"title":"Maine Coon","text":"With their sweet temperament, bushy tails and longhaired shaggy coats, Maine Coon cats are one of the most recognisable and popular domesticated cat breeds, ranking third most popular in both CFA and GCCF registrations. They have a medium length head with fairly full cheeks and high cheekbones; the muzzle should be square and the chin firm. In profile, they have a shallow concave curve at the bridge of the nose. The ears are a great feature, being large, tall, and wide at the base, set high and usually with long tufts at the tips. They have a personality to match their size. They are high energy and, because of their large size, need plenty of room to play and work off their natural hunting instinct. An assortment of toys and a very strong climbing frame that will support their weight and enable them to access high places will be appreciated.","giphy":"https://media4.giphy.com/media/hRPoV9O14t3vW/giphy.gif","emoji1":582,"emoji2":2,"emoji3":12}
